# Humanizer Technical Module: Code & Engineering

This module applies technical metrics and standards (MISRA, SonarQube, ISO) to identify AI-generated code and technical documentation.

## CODE QUALITY METRICS (SonarQube/GitHub Research)

### 1. Maintainability & Code Smells

- **Sign:** "Pythonic but unsafe" patterns.
- **Action:** Check for succinct but fragile one-liners.
- **Metric:** High Cognitive Complexity in short functions.

### 2. AI Signatures (Code)

- **Sign:** Comments like `// Generated by`, `/* AI-generated */`.
- **Sign:** Redundant comments explaining obvious code (e.g., `i++ // increment i`).
- **Sign:** "Perfect" Javadoc/Docstrings for trivial methods.

### 3. Test Coverage (IEEE 829)

- **Sign:** "Generic Coverage". Tests that check happy paths but miss boundary conditions.
- **Action:** Look for tests that assert `true` or check only simple return values.

## SAFETY & GOVERNANCE STANDARDS (MISRA/ISO)

### 4. Type Safety (MISRA C/C++)

- **Sign:** Hallucinated or loose types in strict languages.
- **Action:** Verify if imported types actually exist in the project context.
- **Metric:** Usage of `any` or generic `Object` where specific types are standard.

### 5. Control Flow Integrity

- **Sign:** Unchecked recursive loops (AI often misses base cases in complex recursion).
- **Sign:** "Spaghetti code" generated by stitching multiple prompt outputs.

### 6. ISO/IEC 42001 (Transparency)

- **Goal:** Ensure code is "Explainable & Interpretable".
- **Action:** Flag "Black Box" logic where the AI implements a solution without clear reasoning.

## INSTRUCTION FOR TECHNICAL REVIEW

1.  **Context Check:** Is this production code or a script?
2.  **Safety Check:** Apply MISRA rules for Type Safety and Control Flow.
3.  **Smell Check:** Look for "AI Comments" (verbose, stating the obvious).
4.  **Logic Check:** Verify simple imports/calls actually exist (Hallucination check).
