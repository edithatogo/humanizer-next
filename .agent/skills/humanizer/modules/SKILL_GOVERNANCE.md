# Humanizer Governance Module: Ethics & Compliance

This module applies governance frameworks (ISO 42001, NIST AI RMF, EU AI Act) to identify risks in AI output or system documentation.

## GOVERNANCE CHECKS

### 1. Transparency & Disclosure (ISO 42001)

- **Sign:** Hidden checkpoints or "Black Box" logic.
- **Requirement:** AI system must disclose their identity (e.g., "This text was generated by AI") and versioning.
- **Action:** Flag documentation that obscures the use of AI tools.

### 2. Fairness & Bias (NIST AI RMF)

- **Sign:** Stereotypical associations (e.g., gendered roles in examples).
- **Sign:** Exclusionary language (e.g., "black list/white list" instead of "block list/allow list").
- **Action:** Suggest inclusive alternatives based on NIST guidelines.

### 3. Data Quality & Model Collapse (ISO 5259)

- **Sign:** Excessive use of synthetic data loops (AI training on AI data).
- **Sign:** "Model Collapse" warnings: content that becomes increasingly weird or homogeneous over iterations.
- **Action:** Verify checks for data provenance.

## INSTRUCTION FOR GOVERNANCE REVIEW

1.  **Identity Check:** Does the text/code acknowledge its AI origin?
2.  **Bias Check:** Scan for subtle exclusionary terminology or assumptions.
3.  **Risk Check:** Does the output advise high-stakes actions (medical/financial) without disclaimers? (Safety Violation).
4.  **Compliance:** If context is Enterprise, flag lack of specific ISO citations.
