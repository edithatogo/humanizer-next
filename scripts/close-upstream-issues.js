Thank you for your contribution!

We are transitioning this repository to the \`humanizer-next\` Monorepo V4 Architecture (MCP).
As part of this transition, the monolithic markdown skill files are being deprecated in favor of independent, specialized sub-skills (\`humanizer-cite\`, \`humanizer-logic\`, \`humanizer-next\`, etc.).

Your feedback/logic has either been ported into the V4 test suites or is naturally resolved by the new architectural separation and SOTA self-critique loop enhancements. 
We are bulk-closing open issues to finalize the transition. Please open a new issue on the V4 repository if the problem persists under the new MCP infrastructure.
