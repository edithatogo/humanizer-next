# Conflict-of-Sources Resolution Rules: LLM Reasoning Failures

This document defines policies for resolving disagreements between sources when researching LLM reasoning failures.

## Tie-Break Policy

When sources disagree on claims about LLM reasoning failures, use the following hierarchy to determine precedence:

### 1. Authority Ranking (Highest to Lowest)

1. **Peer-reviewed academic papers** - Empirical studies published in reputable venues
2. **Technical reports from major AI labs** - Research from organizations like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta AI
3. **Preprint repositories** - arXiv, ACL Anthology, etc. (with peer review consideration)
4. **Official documentation** - Model cards, system cards, technical documentation
5. **Blog posts from experts** - Written by recognized researchers in the field
6. **Conference presentations** - Peer-reviewed conference papers
7. **Other sources** - Less reliable sources (social media, forums, etc.)

### 2. Recency Consideration

- For rapidly evolving fields, more recent sources may take precedence
- However, foundational studies may remain valid despite age
- Consider the pace of advancement in the specific area of disagreement

### 3. Empirical Strength

- Sources with stronger empirical evidence (larger datasets, more rigorous methodology) take precedence
- Controlled studies over observational studies
- Replicated findings over single studies

### 4. Resolution Process

1. **Identify the conflicting claims** - Document exactly what sources disagree on
2. **Apply the hierarchy** - Rank sources according to the authority ranking
3. **Consider context** - Evaluate if differences might be due to different contexts, models, or methodologies
4. **Note unresolved conflicts** - If sources are equally ranked, document the disagreement and note both sides

### 5. Documentation Requirements

When conflicts are resolved:
- Record the conflicting claims in the evidence log
- Document which source took precedence and why
- Note any nuances or contextual differences
- Include the resolution in the research log

### 6. Exception Handling

- If a lower-ranked source presents compelling evidence that contradicts a higher-ranked source, investigate further
- Flag significant conflicts for expert review
- Consider that newer evidence may overturn older findings
