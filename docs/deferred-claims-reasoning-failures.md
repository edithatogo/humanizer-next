# Deferred/Unverified Claims: LLM Reasoning Failures

This document captures social-only or weakly supported claims related to LLM reasoning failures that require further verification.

## Claims Requiring Verification

### 1. Chain-of-Thought Prompting Failure Modes
- **Source**: Various social media posts and blog articles
- **Claim**: CoT prompting fails in specific scenarios involving multi-step logical reasoning
- **Status**: Deferred - requires primary source verification
- **Notes**: Several anecdotal reports but need peer-reviewed evidence

### 2. Cross-Modal Reasoning Deficits
- **Source**: Conference presentations (not yet published)
- **Claim**: LLMs show particular weaknesses in reasoning that requires combining visual and textual information
- **Status**: Deferred - requires published research verification
- **Notes**: Preliminary findings from unreleased work

### 3. Temporal Reasoning Limitations
- **Source**: Blog post by practitioner
- **Claim**: LLMs struggle with complex temporal reasoning tasks
- **Status**: Deferred - requires primary source verification
- **Notes**: Needs systematic study to confirm

### 4. Mathematical Proof Verification Issues
- **Source**: Forum discussion
- **Claim**: LLMs frequently verify incorrect proofs as correct
- **Status**: Likely True - some evidence exists but scattered
- **Notes**: Partially supported by multiple sources but needs consolidation

## Verification Priorities

1. **High Priority**: Claims that directly impact Humanizer pattern identification
2. **Medium Priority**: Claims that might inform future Humanizer development
3. **Low Priority**: Claims that are tangential to core Humanizer functionality

## Follow-up Actions

- [ ] Search for peer-reviewed papers on CoT failure modes
- [ ] Look for published research on cross-modal reasoning deficits
- [ ] Locate systematic studies on temporal reasoning limitations
- [ ] Compile evidence on mathematical proof verification issues
