Hey! Love the project, I wanted to leave some feedback, the skill itself is great and keepts the writing and tone relatively verbatim but the changes it does make immediatly flags a human project to be 100% on both the basic and advanced scan of GPTZero, could be worth looking into or trying this skill on other models to see if its just a claude thing, Looking forward to updates and improvements! Cheers
