# Humanizer-next

Humanizer-next is the source repository for the Humanizer skill. It builds two maintained outputs:

- `SKILL.md`
- `SKILL_PROFESSIONAL.md`

The repo is organized around the source fragments in `src/`, the compiled root skill files, and the maintenance scripts that rebuild and validate them.

## Layout

- `src/`: canonical source fragments for the compiled skills
- `scripts/`: compiler, validation, and repo maintenance tooling
- `docs/`: repository documentation and workflow notes
- `experiments/`: isolated ideas and extraction candidates
- `conductor/`: track metadata and archived planning history

## Maintenance

```bash
npm run sync
npm run validate
npm test
```

`npm run sync` rebuilds the compiled skill files and refreshes the root manifests. `npm run validate` checks the maintained docs surface. `npm test` runs the Node test suite, the sync check, and the skill tests.

## MCP server

```bash
npm run install:mcp-server
```

## Scope

This repository does not maintain adapter bundles or consumer-specific installation paths. The supported surface is the compiled skill pair plus the source fragments they are built from.
