- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1: Define rules/workflows guidance' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 2: Implement templates
- [ ] Task: Add rule templates for always-on guidance
- [ ] Task: Add workflow templates for user-triggered guidance
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 2: Implement templates' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 3: Validation and documentation
- [ ] Task: Add validation to ensure metadata matches SKILL.md version
- [ ] Task: Update README with Antigravity rules/workflows usage
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 3: Validation and documentation' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 4: Release readiness
- [ ] Task: Run validation and verify SKILL.md unchanged
- [ ] Task: Record adapter versioning approach (doc-only)
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 4: Release readiness' (Protocol in workflow.md)
