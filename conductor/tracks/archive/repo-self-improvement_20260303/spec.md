# Track Specification: Repository Self-Improvement Cycle #1 (2026-03-03)

**Track ID:** `repo-self-improvement_20260303`

**Priority:** P1 (High - Repository Health & Maintenance)

**Type:** Maintenance, Enhancement, Technical Debt Reduction, Self-Improvement

**Estimated Duration:** 2-3 weeks

**Ralph Loop Integration:** Enabled (Phases 2, 3, 6)

**Data Gathered:** 2026-03-03T00:00:00Z

---

## Executive Summary

This is the **first recurring self-improvement cycle** for the humanizer-next repository. The track addresses:

1. **9 open Dependabot PRs** requiring review and merge
2. **20 upstream PRs** from `blader/humanizer` requiring assessment
3. **23 upstream issues** to evaluate for relevance and adoption
4. **Critical bugs** affecting Claude compatibility and shell safety
5. **Major architectural decisions** on modularization and live Wikipedia sync
6. **Security hardening** with no current vulnerabilities but missing policy documentation

## 2026-03-14 Refresh

The original track snapshot is now stale and should not be used as the source of truth for current prioritization.

Fresh data was gathered on **2026-03-13** via `scripts/gather-repo-data.js` and saved to `repo-data.json`.

### Current Snapshot

- **Local repository:** 6 open Dependabot PRs, 0 standalone open issues
- **Upstream repository (`blader/humanizer`):** 24 open PRs, 25 open issues
- **Security posture:** `SECURITY.md` exists locally, but GitHub does not detect a published security policy for either repo

### Current Assessment

1. `humanizer-next` should remain a **skill-source repository**, not a publishable npm library.
2. `.github/workflows/release.yml` is currently **misaligned** with that goal because it still assumes a Changesets + npm publish lifecycle.
3. `.github/workflows/self-improvement.yml` now gathers baseline metrics, live repository data, and decision-oriented issue content. It is stronger than the original placeholder workflow, but it is still not fully closed-loop because maintainers must finalize the Adopt / Reject / Defer outcomes.
4. The citation reference manager was a **scope outlier** relative to the repo's core purpose. It has now been moved behind an explicit experimental boundary at `experiments/citation_ref_manager/`, with the decision documented in `docs/citation-manager-boundary.md`. Follow-on extraction into a separate repo or skill remains a valid option if it graduates from experimentation.
5. The highest-value maintenance work is now:
   - reviewing and merging the 6 current Dependabot PRs,
   - triaging upstream PRs/issues by adoption value,
   - simplifying release/distribution automation around skill artifacts rather than package publishing,
   - and deciding whether experimental subsystems should stay in-tree or be extracted.

- **Status:** Open, 1 comment, no reviews
- **Author:** fernandosmither
- **Created:** Feb 28, 2026
- **Addresses:** Issue #48
- **Changes:** Not visible in fetch (need to review Files Changed tab)
- **Merge Conflicts:** None
- **Reviews:** None yet
- **Priority:** **Critical** - fixes Claude.ai breakage
- **Recommendation:** Review immediately, test in Claude.ai, merge if functional

#### PR #44: feat: live Wikipedia sync for auto-updating AI patterns (v2.3.0)
- **Status:** Open, 4 tasks completed
- **Author:** justinmassa
- **Created:** Feb 26, 2026
- **Implementation:**
  - Fetches patterns from Wikipedia MediaWiki API via `curl`
  - 7-day cache refresh interval
  - Graceful fallback to static patterns on fetch failure
  - Adds `Bash` and `WebFetch` to allowed-tools
  - `.gitignore` for runtime cache file
- **Benefits:**
  - Auto-updates patterns without manual skill updates
  - Community-discovered AI tells picked up automatically
  - Tested with cache miss, cache creation, fallback scenarios
- **Concerns:**
  - ⚠️ External dependency on Wikipedia API stability
  - ⚠️ User-Agent arms race (WebFetch already blocked with 403)
  - ⚠️ Security: `curl` against external URLs in skill processing text
  - ⚠️ No pattern validation/sanitization
  - ⚠️ Cache integrity checks missing
  - ⚠️ Co-authored by "Claude Opus 4.6" (ironic for AI detection tool)
- **Priority:** **High** - major feature but needs security review
- **Recommendation:** 
  - Security review required before merge
  - Add pattern validation
  - Implement cache integrity checks
  - Consider opt-in vs. default behavior

  - **Pattern #26:** Signposting (excessive structural markers)
  - **Pattern #27:** Fragmented headers (incomplete/broken heading structures)
- **Priority:** **High** - expands detection coverage
- **Recommendation:** Review pattern definitions, test on sample texts, merge if quality is good

#### PR #30: feat: implement tiered architecture (v3.0.0)
- **Status:** Open, 1 review
- **Author:** edithatogo

  - Technical literal preservation rules
  - Chain-of-thought reasoning examples
  - Self-verification checklist
- **Benefits:**
  - Better maintainability through separation of concerns
  - SOTA prompting improvements
  - Python migration with 100% test coverage
  - Pre-commit hooks (Ruff, Mypy, Markdownlint)
  - CI/CD automation
  - Adapter validation system
- **Drawbacks:**
  - Increased complexity vs. monolithic design
  - More files to maintain
  - Router overhead for simple tasks
  - 84 commits - large change surface
- **Priority:** **Critical** - major architectural decision
- **Recommendation:** 
  - Architecture decision record (ADR) required

## 3. SOTA Approaches Analysis

### 3.1 Tiered Architecture (v3.0.0)

**Pattern:** Router-Retriever with modular compiler

**Key Features:**
1. **Context-Aware Routing:** Analyzes input type (code, academic, governance, general)
2. **Module Activation:** Only runs relevant detection modules
3. **Severity Classification:** Critical/High/Medium/Low pattern ratings
4. **Technical Literal Preservation:** Protects code blocks, URLs, identifiers
5. **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:** Explicit reasoning before applying fixes
6. **Self-Verification:** Checklist before outputting changes

**Implementation Status:**
- Referenced in `SKILL_PROFESSIONAL.md` but modules don't exist as files
- Modules mentioned: `SKILL_CORE.md`, `SKILL_TECHNICAL.md`, `SKILL_ACADEMIC.md`, `SKILL_GOVERNANCE.md`, `SKILL_REASONING.md`
- **Gap:** These files are missing - only referenced, not implemented

**Recommendation:** Implement modular architecture with hybrid approach:
- Modular source files in `src/modules/`
- Compiled monolithic output for distribution
- Maintains backward compatibility with adapters

---

### 3.2 Live Wikipedia Sync

**Pattern:** External API integration with caching

**Key Features:**
1. **Auto-Update:** Fetches latest patterns from Wikipedia MediaWiki API
2. **Caching:** 7-day refresh interval
3. **Fallback:** Graceful degradation to static patterns
4. **Tool Requirements:** `Bash` (curl) and `WebFetch`

**Security Concerns:**
1. External dependency on Wikipedia API
2. `curl` execution in skill context
3. No pattern validation/sanitization
4. Cache integrity not verified
5. AI co-authorship (trust issue)

**Recommendation:** Implement with safeguards:
- Opt-in behavior (not default)
- Pattern validation against schema
- Cache integrity checks (hash verification)
- Security review of curl implementation
- Logging for fetch failures

---

### 3.3 Pattern Expansion (#25-27)

**New Patterns:**
1. **Persuasive Tropes:** Clichéd rhetorical devices
2. **Signposting:** Excessive structural markers ("First...", "Second...", "In conclusion...")
3. **Fragmented Headers:** Incomplete or broken heading structures

**Recommendation:** Adopt after quality review

---

### 3.4 Severity Classification

**Pattern:** Critical/High/Medium/Low ratings for each detection

**Benefits:**
- Users can prioritize fixes
- Better transparency on impact
- Aligns with security industry standards

**Recommendation:** Adopt
