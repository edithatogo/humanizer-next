- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1: Define skill package' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 2: Implement skill package
- [ ] Task: Add Antigravity skill directory and required files
- [ ] Task: Add README or usage guidance for the skill
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 2: Implement skill package' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 3: Validation and documentation
- [ ] Task: Add validation to ensure metadata matches SKILL.md version
- [ ] Task: Update README with Antigravity skill usage
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 3: Validation and documentation' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 4: Release readiness
- [ ] Task: Run validation and verify SKILL.md unchanged
- [ ] Task: Record adapter versioning approach (doc-only)
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 4: Release readiness' (Protocol in workflow.md)
