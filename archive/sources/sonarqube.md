## Summary

SonarQube provides static code analysis metrics that are increasingly relevant for AI-generated code quality assessment.

## Key Metrics

1. **Maintainability:** Technical debt ratio, smell density.
2. **Reliability:** Bug detection rate.
3. **Security:** Vulnerability scanning (SAST).
4. **Duplications:** Copy-paste detection (Dry violations).
5. **Cyclomatic Complexity:** Independent code paths.
6. **Cognitive Complexity:** Understandability.
7. **Test Coverage:** Unit test execution.

## Key Findings (Mapped to Matrix)

- **Complexity:** AI code can vary; often lower complexity if simple, but higher if hallucinated.
- **Code Smells:** AI code may introduce specific patterns (e.g., redundant logic).
