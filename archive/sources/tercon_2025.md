## Abstract

Large language models (LLMs) are solidifying their position in the modern world... [Summary from abstract]
Among the most-often reported findings is the observation that AI-generated text is more likely to contain a **more formal and impersonal style**, signaled by the **increased presence of nouns, determiners, and adpositions** and the **lower reliance on adjectives and adverbs**. AI-generated text is also more likely to feature a **lower lexical diversity**, a **smaller vocabulary size**, and **repetitive text**.

## Key Findings (Mapped to Matrix)

- **Formal/Impersonal Tone:** High formal register, lack of personal voice.
- **Nominalization:** High noun/determiner density.
- **Low Lexical Diversity:** Low Type-Token Ratio (TTR).
- **Repetitiveness:** N-gram repetition.

## Notes

- Reviews 44 peer-reviewed studies.
- Highlights bias against non-native English speakers.
- Discusses prompt sensitivity.
