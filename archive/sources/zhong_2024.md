## Abstract

Using large-scale empirical data, we examine and benchmark the characteristics and quality of essays generated by popular LLMs... Our findings highlight limitations in existing automated scoring systems, such as e-rater, when applied to essays generated or heavily influenced by AI.

## Key Findings (Mapped to Matrix)

- **e-rater Features:** Grammar, Mechanics, Usage, Style, Organization, Development, Word Complexity.
- **Cross-Model Detection:** Detectors trained on one model can often identify texts from others (generalization).
- **Perplexity:** 99.7% accuracy on GPT-4.
- **Essay Length/Structure:** AI tends to produce uniform structures.

## Methodology

- 2,000 essays (10 LLMs x 100).
- Comparison with human controls.
- Scoring via e-rater® engine.
