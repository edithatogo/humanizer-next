# Citation Reference Manager - Final Summary

## Overview
The Citation Reference Manager is a comprehensive skill module designed to validate and manage citations within the humanizer project. It prevents AI hallucinations by ensuring all references are stored in a canonical CSL-JSON file, verifying manuscript citations, validating URLs and DOIs, enriching references using authoritative databases, and converting to multiple standard formats.

## Key Features

### 1. Citation Verification
- Validates that all citations in a manuscript have corresponding entries in the CSL-JSON reference list
- Identifies missing citations and unused references
- Provides detailed verification reports

### 2. Reference Enrichment
- Enriches citations using CrossRef API
- Calculates confidence scores for each citation
- Implements a confidence-based verification system
- Provides manual verification interface for low-confidence items

### 3. Format Conversion
- Converts CSL-JSON to multiple formats: YAML, RIS, BibLaTeX, EndNote XML, ENW
- Validates converted formats for accuracy
- Ensures compatibility across different citation management systems

### 4. Reference Verification
- Validates URLs and DOIs for accessibility
- Checks for broken links and invalid identifiers
- Provides verification status for each citation

### 5. Storage Management
- Manages canonical CSL-JSON reference files
- Handles deduplication of references
- Ensures all fields required for downstream use are correctly coded

## Subskills

### validate-citations
Checks manuscript citations against the CSL-JSON file to ensure all references are properly cited.

### enrich-references
Connects to databases to enhance reference information with confidence-based verification.

### format-converter
Handles conversion between different citation formats (YAML, RIS, BibLaTeX, EndNote XML, ENW).

### reference-verifier
Validates URLs, DOIs, and other reference details for accuracy and accessibility.

## Integration with Humanizer Framework
The citation reference manager integrates seamlessly with the humanizer skill framework, ensuring that AI-generated content is properly grounded in real, verifiable sources. It serves as a "truth anchor" for AI-generated content, ensuring all references are real and verifiable, thus humanizing AI output.

## Usage Example

```javascript
import { validateCitations, enrichReferences, formatConverter, referenceVerifier } from './citation_ref_manager/index.js';

// Validate citations in a manuscript
const verificationResult = await validateCitations(manuscriptText, cslJson);

// Enrich references using external databases
const enrichmentResult = await enrichReferences(cslJson);

// Convert to different formats
const yamlOutput = formatConverter(cslJson, 'yaml');
const risOutput = formatConverter(cslJson, 'ris');

// Verify URLs and DOIs
const verificationResult = await referenceVerifier(cslJson);
```

## Impact
This skill module significantly enhances the humanizer's ability to detect and prevent AI-generated content that relies on hallucinated or unverifiable citations. By ensuring all references are real and properly formatted, it helps maintain academic integrity in AI-assisted writing and creates a bridge between AI-generated content and scholarly rigor.
