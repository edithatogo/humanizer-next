---

## GOVERNANCE PATTERNS

### Pattern G1: Vague Policy Language

**Problem:** AI uses imprecise language in policies where specificity is required.

**Severity:** High

**Before:**

> Employees should generally endeavor to maintain appropriate security practices where feasible.

**After:**

> Employees must enable two-factor authentication on all company accounts.

---

### Pattern G2: Hedged Risk Statements

**Problem:** AI over-hedges risk statements, weakening accountability.

**Severity:** High

**Before:**

> There may potentially be some risk that data could possibly be compromised in certain circumstances.

**After:**

> Risk: Unencrypted data in transit may be intercepted. Likelihood: Medium. Impact: High.

---

### Pattern G3: Promotional Compliance Language

**Problem:** AI uses marketing language in compliance documents.

**Severity:** Medium

**Words to watch:**

- "commitment to excellence", "dedication to"
- "best-in-class", "industry-leading"
- "unwavering commitment", "paramount importance"

**Before:**

> Our unwavering commitment to data protection demonstrates our dedication to best-in-class security practices.

**After:**

> We comply with GDPR Article 32 (security of processing) through encryption, access controls, and regular audits.

---

### Pattern G4: Vague Attributions in Policy

**Problem:** AI attributes requirements to vague authorities.

**Severity:** High

**Words to watch:**

- "Industry standards require"
- "Regulations state"
- "Experts recommend"

**Before:**

> Industry standards require regular security assessments.

**After:**

> SOC 2 Type II requires annual security assessments (AICPA, 2023).

---

### Pattern G5: Formulaic "Future Outlook" Sections

**Problem:** AI adds generic forward-looking statements to governance docs.

**Severity:** Low

**Before:**

> Looking ahead, we remain committed to continuous improvement. The future looks bright as we enhance our governance framework.

**After:**

> Next review date: 2027-03-03. Responsible: Chief Compliance Officer.

---

### Pattern G6: Over-Structured Risk Matrices

**Problem:** AI uses rigid formatting for risk descriptions that humans would write narratively.

**Severity:** Low

**Before:**

> **Risk Category:** Cybersecurity
> **Likelihood:** High
> **Impact:** Critical
> **Mitigation:** Implement controls

**After:**

> Cybersecurity risk is high with critical potential impact. Mitigation: implement access controls, encryption, and monitoring.

---

### Pattern G7: Filler in Legal Writing

**Problem:** AI adds unnecessary words to legal/policy text.

**Severity:** Medium

**Before:**

> In the event that an employee fails to comply with the provisions set forth herein, disciplinary action may be taken.

**After:**

> Employees who violate this policy face disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

---

### Pattern G8: Generic Positive Conclusions

**Problem:** AI ends governance docs with vague upbeat statements.

**Severity:** Low

**Before:**

> We are confident that these measures will ensure a bright and secure future for our organization.

**After:**

> This policy takes effect 2026-04-01. Questions: [compliance@company.com](mailto:compliance@company.com)

## COMPLIANCE AND REGULATORY

### Pattern G9: Vague Regulatory References

**Problem:** AI references regulations without specific sections or requirements.

**Severity:** High

**Before:**

> We comply with all applicable data protection regulations.

**After:**

> We comply with:
>
> - GDPR (EU) 2016/679: Articles 5, 6, 32
> - CCPA (California): Section 1798.100
> - HIPAA (US): 45 CFR Part 160
