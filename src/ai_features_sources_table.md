## Key Findings Across Sources

| **Feature Category**    | **Most Influential** | **Typical AI Pattern**          | **Human Pattern**               | **Detection Confidence**     |

## Limitations & Caveats

1. **Bias Issues**: AI detectors show bias against non-native English speakers (false positives elevated); prefer formal writing.
2. **Model-Specific**: Features vary by LLM version (GPT-3.5 vs. GPT-4; open-source models differ); detector generalization is partial.
3. **Domain-Dependent**: Features optimized for academic writing; less effective on news, code, dialogue.
4. **Prompt Sensitivity**: Rephrasing/obfuscation prompts degrade detection (80%→60% accuracy in some cases).
5. **Short Text Challenge**: Features require sufficient length (>200-500 words) to reliably detect; short texts ambiguous.
6. **Arms Race Risk**: As LLMs improve, detection requires continuous retraining (though development cycle is faster).
7. **Cross-Study Variation**: Accuracy claims range 80-100% due to dataset, model, and methodology differences.

## Recommendations for Practitioners

1. **Use Multiple Features**: Single metrics (e.g., perplexity alone) insufficient; ensemble of 5-10 features recommended.
2. **Domain-Specific Training**: Retrain models on target domain (academic vs. news vs. code).
3. **Prioritize Transparency**: Feature-based approaches (Random Forest, Logistic Regression) preferred over black-box transformers for audit/compliance.
4. **Cross-Model Testing**: Evaluate detector on multiple LLMs (GPT, Llama, Mistral, Claude, Gemini) to ensure robustness.
5. **Regular Updates**: Revalidate detectors every 3-6 months as LLMs evolve.
6. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Use detectors as decision-support, not final arbiter; human review remains critical.
7. **Standards Adoption**: Align with NIST AI RMF and ISO standards for governance/transparency.

## Final Notes

This table aggregates **30+ authoritative sources** (peer-reviewed, industry standards, open-source, government frameworks) covering **text** and **code** analysis in AI contexts. The evidence base is strongest for **academic writing detection** (95-100% accuracy achievable) and **code quality metrics** (80-96% correlation with human assessment), but weaker for **cross-domain generalization** and **advanced LLM versions**. Users should consult **domain-specific sources** (e.g., MISRA for embedded code; Desaire et al. for chemistry) and combine multiple methodologies for highest confidence.
