This PR refactors the skill into modular fragments and introduces the Humanizer Pro variant. 

Key changes:
- Modular source fragments in src/ to prevent duplication of core patterns.
- Build system in sync-adapters.ps1 to assemble variants.
- Professional variant focused on 'Voice and Craft'.
- Updated all adapters and documentation.
